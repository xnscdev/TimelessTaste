# Timeless Taste

### About

Timeless Taste is a web application that is built for senior citizens who are looking for recipe ideas based on their dietary preferences and restrictions.

### Features

Users can create an account to save their dietary information, including allergies and diet (e.g. keto, paleo, etc.). On the home page, users can then tell Timeless Taste what food they would like to eat, and a recipe with ingredients and nutritional information will be generated with the help of AI.

All previous recipes will be saved! So users can see their history and reuse recipes as they see fit.

### Installation

To install all dependencies, run ‘npm install’ in the terminal. Then, to run the program, run ‘npm run start’. Happy cooking!
